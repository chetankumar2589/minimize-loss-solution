Rajeev has a chart of distinct projected prices for a house over the next several years. He must buy the house in one year and sell it in another, and he must do so at a loss. He wants to minimize her financial loss.
Eg:
price = [20, 15, 7, 2, 13]

His minimum loss is incurred by purchasing in year 2 at price[1] and selling in year 5 at price[4]
Write code that takes as input the number of years and prices for those years and outputs the year to buy and sell in with the loss value
